This repo is setup to illustrate a problem (?) with using snakemake modules
from github

Clone this repo locally and run snakemake from a directory above the cloned
repo, using the wrapper `run.sh`

This snakefile will 'import' lpagie/repo2, which in current form only contains
outcommented rules and a rule which is (supposedly) not meaningful for repo1.  
Running the snakemake of repo1 will not generate the output specified by rule
'all' (`output/final`) but instead output generated by rule 'non-sense' ....

When the import of the repo2 module is outcommented from repo1/snakefile_1.smk,
running the snakemake generates the expected outcome.
