This repo is setup to illustrate a problem (?) with using snakemake modules
from github  
The problem turned out to be my misunderstanding of how the default target rule
is determined. See this stackoverflow question and accepted answer for
background and explanation (https://stackoverflow.com/q/69464296/4768122).

This repo is a copy of lpagie/repo1 which functions correctly. This is because
the target rule 'all' is defined before the rule of the imported module are
imported.

Clone this repo locally and run snakemake from a directory above the cloned
repo, using the wrapper `run.sh`

This snakefile **will** 'import' lpagie/repo2.  
Running the snakemake of repo1 *will* generate the output specified by rule
'all' (`output/final`) and `output/final_wf2` which is generated by a rule of
the imported module.
